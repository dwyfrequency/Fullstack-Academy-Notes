# NPM-Notes

## Quick Tips

- When cloning a node project, your first step is usually running npm install before testing. By invoking npm install without specififying any package, npm will look into the projects listed dependencies (inside package.json) and install all of them.

## package.json

- One of package.json's roles is to store our defined scripts. We can add commands here to start our server, run tests, create our build, etc.
