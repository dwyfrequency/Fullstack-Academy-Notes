To fix the blank site issue on deploy, be sure to add

```
# example netlify.toml
[build]
command = "gatsby build"
functions = "functions"
publish = "public"รง
```

To get functions running `netlify dev` to build project with your functions
To get the templates for serverless functions, `netlify functions:create`
