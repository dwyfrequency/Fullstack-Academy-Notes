#### Weekend 1: Fitness Tracker and Pixelate

- Notes:

  I completed the checkpoint for the fitness tracker. The fitness tracker used flexbox and vanilla js. At first for the tracker, I had a giant func to calc analytics for the sidebar. Then, I broke it down into multiple tiny functions. I didnt write any tests for it. In the future, I'm going to try and do more test driven development

  Next, I tried to redo the [pixelate project](https://github.com/dwyfrequency/Reactive-Pixel-Board) in react. I created a monolith component App using hooks. I had an issue with the design of the component. Should I break it down into multiple. How do I handle the functions to paint all the cells, and paint the remaining. I found the project to be easy when down with vanilla js, but incredibly difficult with react.

  - Issues with pixelate:

    - what should i componentize?
    - do i need to employ useEffect?
    - what should i maintain in the state?
    - how should i dynamically update each cell without re-rending the whole board and losing the styling?

- Takeaways:
  I need to focus on component design, understanding the useEffect hook and its use cases, what warrants being in state.

### Week 2
